is bond\nI see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\nCause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd

gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what Im saying?\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that’s rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin’, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true\nRight\nYou know what I’m saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it’s no problem, you know\nI mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know\nI’m finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\nWe fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\nCause once you turn 30 it’s like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don’t wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don’t believe me, you can look around\nYou don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\nThat’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores\nAnd next time its a riot its

murder, you know what I’m saying?\nIt’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen\nThat’s crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\nBecause its spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt’s actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe’s trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\nWhat’s your perspective on that?\nPac?

We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think what a cute guy, and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...\nSo, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.", "I love the way you put it on your eyes\nThe roses on your face light up the sky\nThose lips are colorful all of the time\nAnd girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?\nNo makeup today, no makeup today, today\nNo makeup today, no makeup today\nAnd girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?\nI know she bout to ask me how she look\nI tell her beautiful and how long it took\nFor you to put it on, it was early in the morn\nShe resembled a model out of a MAC book\nConcentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens\nI stand behind her and try to figure her vision\nOf prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone\nHer complexion in a direction Ive outgrown\nDamn girl, why so much?\nYou bout to blow your cover when you cover up\nDont you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?\nFrom Heaven is where you got it from\nI love your smile, you can do it without style\nFrom your lips all the way to your eyebrows\nIts the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur\nI dont see it, all I see is a blur\nI love the way you put it on your eyes\nThe roses on your face light up the sky\nThose lips are colorful all of the time\nAnd girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?\nNo makeup today, no makeup today, today\nNo makeup today, no makeup today\nAnd girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?\nI know she bout to ask me how she look\nI tell her beautiful and how long it took\nFor you to put it on, it was early in the morn\nShe resembled a model out of a MAC book\nConcentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens\nHe stand behind me and try to figure her vision\nOf prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone\nMy complexion in a direction Ive outgrown\nI feel like its not enough\nI can never put on too much makeup\nYeah, I know your imperfections, I be constantly stressing\nFrom him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to\nSmile at least once in a while\nI hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows\nIts the beauty in me, but what he dont see\nIs that I had a black eye— to be continued, eleven\nLadies and gentlemen\nAnd you aint gotta get drunk to have fun\nYou aint gotta get drunk to have fun\nAnd you aint gotta get drunk to have fun\nYou aint gotta get drunk to have fun\nI love the way you put it on your eyes\nThe roses on your face light up the sky\nThose lips are colorful all of the time\nAnd girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?\nNo makeup today, no makeup today, today\nNo makeup today, no makeup today\nAnd girl, thats fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?", "This what you really want, huh?\nTurn me up, Ali\nI know your image of me\nIs what I hope to be\nBlack lip bastard, pass me your password\nSo I can hack inside your brain\nSee, I too have gone insane\nBefore I fall Im sure to curse you all in Jesus name\nLead shower, Anna Peebles hour, bitch stand the rain\nThis what yall really want\nLet me get it back Ali\nWhen we do- when we do interviews, dont ask me bout no movements\nYeah Im good\nNo crews, no-no posses, no cliques\nIf it aint bout TDE I dont wanna hear that shit, bitch\nLook inside my parkin garage and see a collage\nOf every person I despised since the moment I turned five\nCalculate my steps and strategically took my time\nEven fallin off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj \nEat that pink pussy like its Friday\nBust one, roam and reload, then smoke to Sade\nAnd somebody tell Rihanna too\nI need that vagina too \nDont fuckin take me for some kind of fool\nIm kinda the reminder of knowin Compton aint kinda cool\nGood kid, mad city, mountaintops couldnt see my views\nCountertops, we hop over, hit the register, then we move\nI hope this shit can register on a regular soon\nBefore I climb this pedestal\nAnd make you catch my fuckin stool \nK.Dot, leave em grievin on evenin news\nEven when society break even, Ill break rules\nI told niggas, caught wrecked, then I towed niggas\nFold niggas like clothes and drawers, nigga\nHomie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg\nLike a cliché to rock a show, is that over your head?\nNiggas stretchin the truth like they choose to do yoga instead\nEither that or they depressed, eatin yogurt in bed\nSolar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle\nThe bass bit the bait, Im straight, you a gay couple\nI aint thirsty for the deal, wait and make em pay double\nIm anxious, when the bacon on the table, I need a muzzle\nYoure basic like cable to a satellite dish\nYou was runnin L.A., now you out of there like Fish\nWhat more can I say?

the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner.\nScene 2: The Hotel Room\nHearing the chorus Loving you is complicated - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film.\nScene 3: Mirror\nThe mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter I  tell you, you  failure—you aint no leader!, the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made.\nScene 4: Tipsy\nStumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V. of what it is like to be overly intoxicated.\nScene 5: Room Service\nThe skit from u begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene.DialogueEffect on the Audience\n Transitional Slide - 8\nScene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle\nA very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself.\nNotice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do its own thing every now and then.\nScene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror\nAn easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide.\n Transitional Slide - Clearance sale: 100% off PART 2: For Sale \nScene 1: The Dunk\nA symbolistic baptism that takes Kendrick under thats meant to cleanse him from his impurities and sins of the night to be reborn again. This scene is a complete contrast from Scene 2 which compliments to criticism of the hip hop industry in For Sale.\n Transitional Slide - Life is like a box of chickens\n Transitional Slide - Instagram 2016: Dussy unlimited\n Transitional Slide - If I blame you for a loss, I’ll be giving you all the credit\n Transitional Slide - Good dussy can make you melt\nScene 2: Lust\nLucys temptations are all around Kendrick whether its smoking weed, making him famous or filling his pockets with money these comparisons are depicted through the naked women in scene.\n Transitional Slide - Always trust a n with cornrows\nScene 3: Lost/Distractions\nIt seems like Kendrick is trying to keep focus and maintain what is important to him, looking unaware and lost he is staring into the same place not noticing the women and putting aside these distractions.

We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.\nIt turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his little bro—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendricks parents house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.\nSo today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York Citys fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isnt sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, hes telling me about Chad. It all happened when I was overseas, he says. I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.\nIts been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.\nIt actually began late last year, when Kendricks major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his moms minivan chasing that crazy-ass girl Sherane—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster raps violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. Hes the games most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dudes house—and its this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like youre putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:If Pirus and Crips all got along Theyd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Seans song Control—a guest spot on a song that didnt even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself the king of New York, which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.\nControl leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.\nKendricks career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keatons memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it back to the set to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. It can be complicated and confusing, Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. From my perspective, its not just Im famous—I still live in this world. And when someone back home needs something, I still gotta get that phone call.\nIts clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.\nA bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: When the cameras stop rolling, it doesnt mean real life will follow. Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.\nOn the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over Control was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyns Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on Control, and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drakes VMA performance of Hold On, Were Going Home, Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. You watch, he joked, Im going to be singing by my fifth album!\nI asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. Pretty cool. Shrugs. And I mean, I would be okay if we werent.\nA month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drakes new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the Control thing: You cant just say that and then see me and be like, Yeah, man, whats up?—pretending like nothing ever happened. Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped Control / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.\nI got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzys public lash-out—Control named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis, Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesnt look up to Drake, doesnt see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, No—peer. If anything. We all peers.\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that hes not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.\nI was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Moms couch. Im 26 now—it wasnt that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. Im not huge on superstition and all that shit. Thats what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, Dont let the music die. Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like hes right there. Just a silhouette.\nThe visit from Pac changed Kendricks connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. It wasnt just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin, he explains. I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that theres people out there that cant really connect to that lifestyle. Theyre in the struggle.\nMuch of Kendricks music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his households chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhoods warped commitment to adolescent pride. Its an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesnt smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. When I ask OGs why theres so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows, he says. But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.\nA few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendricks hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendricks Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, Aw, man, I cant go to no club.\nKendrick spoke up.\nWe have to go.\nLook at you! We have to go. Youre never we have to go.\nYou know me, Kendrick explained. I only go when theres a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the Control verse? Thats a point!\nTwenty minutes later, Anthony Top Dawg Tiffith, basically TDEs Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. You guys seem so calm, I said.\nWell, Tiffith told me, were going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.The gossip from Diddys Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the King of New York boast, attempted to pour a drink over Kendricks head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. It was all love at that party, he told me on the private jet.\nAfter we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.\nBy the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. Theres chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for Swimming Pools , a song about his familys dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.\nIts hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawgs booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. I dont know, he says. It depends on where my emotion is. How angry Ill be, or how happy Ill be, or how confused Ill be.\nAt one point on good kid Kendrick raps, I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous. The biggest change in Kendricks life is the inversion of raps consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because hes already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.", "I guess you could say, Its not easy\nI guess you could say, You live and learn\nI want yall to all em, I paid my dues\nAnd when its all said and done, I did it my way\nOhhhhhh\nAs the city lights up the night I feel soooo good cause I did it my way\nAnd I knowwww that Im just livin the life of girls and gold\nAnd I feel so good cause I did it my way\nNights bright like Vegas\nThe life of girls and gold is so contagious\nI been cold\nTook the C-O double M road\nHangin out the windows\nReachin for the world as the wind blows\nThe crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear\nIm proud to be here, now that we here\nThis year, you could find me at The Cosmopolitan\nHoldin bottles, never bottled in\nProbly with Chicagoans\nAnd theres black girls modellin, lookin for a followin\nAttitude is tolerant, Im married to the game like Solomon\nThese rings represent the dreams we got from the old folk\nYearnin for The Gold Coast\nMy soul spoke things that was necessary\nFound forever in ways that are legendary\nAnd through the drama, I stuck to my commentary\nNow that everyday man say that Comm is every-where\nOhhhhhh\nAs the city lights up the night I feel soooo good cause I did it my way\nAnd I knowwww that Im just livin the life of girls and gold\nAnd I feel so good cause I did it my way\nI used to dream of risin now I see it clearer\nHow surprising, Im admiring that mirror\nIm inspiring the finer things in life\nAnd your time is slowly expiring, youre crying me a river\nThats ironic because she have a river as well\nI like to swim in it like Olympians, Y-S-L\nAnd some Timberlands, high as hell\nA ceilin is an understatement, I burn through it, prove its a fire drill\nFire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes\nFire then re-hire hoes\nHer entire crew is tired of the liars that you runnin by her\nI can see you, hoe\nPlenty priors of a fuck nigga, nigga, I suppose\nI can fly her, put her in attire of designer clothes\nDayton wires on the Chevy, why are you not tolerable?\nDont you know they already fuck me, Im a made man\nMaids in the mansion, clean em up out here\nOhhhhhh\nAs the city lights up the night I feel soooo good cause I did it my way\nAnd I knowwww that Im just livin the life of girls and gold\nAnd I feel so good cause I did it my way\nCommon\nKendrick\nLloyd\nGood cause I did it my way\nAnd I knowwww\nHit-Boy\nDrama\nAnd I feel so good cause I did it my way", "These streets is jurassic, cowards get asthmatic\nAstronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb\nPull up on the curb , smoke a nigga then dip\nIts the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent\nThis is Jesus of Nazareth\nSpittin gold policies to a world unknown\nIn a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds\nPrestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed\nCan corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick\nScreaming bitches aint shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower\nI dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder\nNo challengers can compete, theyre childish and weak, detrimental\nHazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein\nIm kurupted!\nIm kurupted!\nGimme a hundred Gs for every Emcee I drop to their knees\nVerbically useless, oh you got the Juice?

Into the parking lot of a local hamburger stand pulls a chromed-out black Mercedes SUV, driven by 27-year-old Kendrick Lamar, arguably the most talented rapper of his generation. there are a half-dozen guys from the neighborhood waiting to meet him: L, Turtle, G-Weed. I grew up with all these cats, Lamar says. He nods to Mingo, a Compton-born sweetheart who is roughly the size of the truck he arrived in: I dont need to hire a bodyguard. Look how fucking big he is! The burger joint, Tams, sits at the corner of Rosecrans and Central, a famous local spot recently made infamous when Suge Knight allegedly ran over two men with his truck in the parking lot, killing one of them. Homey died right here, G-Weed says, pointing to a dark spot on the asphalt. That security camera caught everything. Theyre building a case.\nLamar grew up just six blocks from here, in a little blue three-bedroom house at 1612 137th St. Across the street is the Louisiana Fried Chicken where he used to get the three-piece meal with fries and lemonade; over there is the Rite Aid where he walked to buy milk for his little brothers. Tams was another hangout. This is where I seen my second murder, actually. he says. Eight years old, walking home from McNair Elementary. Dude was in the drive-thru ordering his food, and homey ran up, boom boom - smoked him. He saw his first murder at age five, a teenage drug dealer gunned down outside Lamars apartment building. After that, he says, you just get numb to it.\nIts almost noon, but Lamar is just starting his day - having spent a late night in the studio scrambling to finish his new album, To Pimp a Butterfly, which has to be done in five days. Hes dressed casually in a gray hoodie, maroon sweatpants, and white socks with black slides, but recognizable enough that an old lady in line decides to tease him while complaining about the heat inside. Yall need to put the air conditioner on, she calls to the manager. Kendrick Lamar is here!\nLamar may be a two-time Grammy winner with a platinum debut executive-produced by Dr. Dre, and with fans from Kanye West to Taylor Swift. But here at Tams, hes also Kendrick Duckworth, Paula and Kennys son. Inside, a middle-aged woman who just left church comes up and gives him a hug, and he buys lunch for a cart-toting lady he knows used to be a harmless crack addict. Outside, an old man in a motorized wheelchair scoots over to introduce himself. He says he moved here in 1951, when Compton was still majority-white. Back in the day, we had the baddest cars in L.A., he says. I just wanted you to know where you came from. Its a hell of a neighborhood.\nOn his breakthrough album, 2012s good kid, m.A.A.d City, Lamar made his name by chronicling this neighborhood, vividly evoking a specific place and a specific time . It was a concept album about adolescence, told with cinematic precision through the eyes of someone young enough to recall every detail \nLamars parents moved here from Chicago in 1984, three years before Kendrick was born. His dad, Kenny Duckworth, was reportedly running with a South Side street gang called the Gangster Disciples, so his mom, Paula Oliver, issued an ultimatum. She said, I cant fuck with you if you aint trying to better yourself, Lamar recounts. We cant be in the streets forever. They stuffed their clothes in two black garbage bags and boarded a train to California with $500. They were going to go to San Bernardino, Lamar says. But my Auntie Tina was in Compton. She got em a hotel until they got on their feet, and my mom got a job at McDonalds. For the first couple of years, they slept in their car or motels, or in the park when it was hot enough. Eventually, they saved enough money to get their first apartment, and thats when they had me.\nLamar has a lot of good memories of Compton as a kid: riding bikes, doing back flips off friends roofs, sneaking into the living room during his parents house parties. Then theres one of his earliest memories - the afternoon of April 29th, 1992, the first day of the South Central riots\nKendrick was four. I remember riding with my pops down Bullis Road, and looking out the window and seeing motherfuckers just running, he says. I can see smoke. We stop, and my pops goes into the AutoZone and comes out rolling four tires. I know he didnt buy them. Im like, Whats going on? \nThen we get to the house, Lamar continues, and him and my uncles are like, We fixing to get this, we fixing to get that, we fixing to get all this shit! Im thinking theyre robbing. Theres some real mayhem going on in L.A. Then, as time progresses, Im watching the news, hearing about Rodney King and all this, I said to my mom, So the police beat up a black man, and now everybodys mad? Ok. I get it now.\nWeve been sitting on the patio a while when Lamar sees someone he knows at the bus stop. Matt Jeezy! What up, bro? Matt Jeezy nods. Thats my boy, Lamar says. Hes part of the inner circle. Lamar has a few friends like this, guys hes known all his life. But often hed rather be by himself\nHe was always a loner, Kendricks mom says. Lamar agrees: I was always in the corner of the room watching. He has two little brothers and one younger sister, but until he was seven, he was an only child. He was so precocious his parents nicknamed him Man-Man. I grew up fast as fuck, he says. My moms used to walk me home from school - we didnt have no car - and wed talk from the county building to the welfare office. He would ask me questions about Section 8 and the Housing Authority, so Id explain it to him, his mom says. I was keeping it real.\nThe Duckworths survived on welfare and food stamps, and Paula did hair for $20 a head. His dad had a job at KFC, but at a certain point, says Lamar, I realized his work schedule wasnt really adding up. It wasnt until later that he suspected Kenny was probably making money off the streets. They wanted to keep me innocent, Lamar says now. I love them for that. To this day, he and his dad have never discussed it. I dont know what type of demons he has, Lamar says, but I dont wanna bring them shits up. \nTheres a famous story from Tom Pettys childhood in which a 10-year-old Tom sees Elvis shooting a movie near his hometown in Florida, takes on look at the white Cadillac and the girls, and decides to become a rock star on the spot. Lamar has a similar story - only for him its sitting on his dads shoulders outside the Compton Swap Meet, age eight, watching Dr. Dre and 2Pac shoot a video for California Love. I want to say they were in a white Bentley, Lamar says. These motorcycle cops trying to conduct traffic but one almost scraped the car, and Pac stood up on the passenger seat, like, Yo, what the fuck! He laughs. Yelling at the police, just like on his motherfucking songs. He gave us what we wanted.\nBeing a rapper was far from preordained for Lamar. As late as middle school, he had a noticeable stutter. Just certain words, he says. It came when I was excited or in trouble. He loved basketball - he was short, but quick - and dreamed of making it to the NBA. But in seventh grade, an English teacher named Mr. Inge turned him on to poetry - rhymes, metaphors, double-entendres - and Lamar fell in love. You could put all your feelings down on a sheet of paper, and theyd make sense to you, he says. I liked that.\nAt home, Lamar started writing non-stop. We used to wonder what he was doing with all that paper, his dad says. I thought he was doing homework! I didnt know he was writing lyrics. I had never heard him say profanity before, says his mom. Then I found his little rap lyrics, and it was all Eff you. D-i-c-k. Im like, Oh, my God! Kendricks a cusser!\nAn A student, Lamar flirted with the idea of going to college. I could have went. I should have went. But by the time he was in high school, he was running with a bad crowd. This is the crew he raps about on good kid, m.A.A.d City - the ones doing robberies, home invasions, running from the cops\nOnce his mom found a bloody hospital gown, from a trip he took to the ER with one of his little homeys who got smoked. Another time she found him curled up crying in the front yard. She thought he was sad because his grandmother had just died: I didnt know somebody had shot at him. One night, the police knocked on their door and said he was involved in an incident in their neighborhood, and his parents, in a bout of tough love, kicked him out for two days. And thats a scary thing, Lamar says, because you might not come back.\nAfter a couple of hours, the mood on Rosecrans starts to shift. An ambulance roars by, sirens blaring. In the middle of the street, a homeless man is shouting at passing cars. Lamar starts to grow uneasy, his eyes glancing at the corners. I ask if everythings OK. Its the temperature, he says. Its uh, raising a little bit. A few minutes later, one of his friends - whos been cruising back and forth on his bicycle all afternoon, patrolling the perimeter - calls out, Rollers! and a few seconds later, two L.A. County sherrif cruisers round the corner. There they go, Lamar says, as they hit their lights and take off\nAs a teenager, the majority of my interactions with police were not good, Lamar says. There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since Im a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old, he says, nodding toward the street. Right there by that bus stop. Even if hes not a good kid, that dont give you the right to slam a minor on the ground, or pull a pistol on him.\nLamar says hes had police pull guns on him on two occasions. The first was when he was 17, cruising around Compton with his friend Moose. He says a cop spotted their flashy green Camaro and pulled them over, and when Moose couldnt find his license fast enough, the cop pulled a gun. He literally put the beam on my boys head, Lamar recalls. I remember driving off in a silence, feeling violated, and him being so angry a tear dropped from his eye. The story of the second time is murkier: Lamar wont say what he and his friends were up to, only that a cop drew his gun and they ran. We was in the wrong, he admits. But we just kids. Its not worth pulling your gun out over. Especially when we running away.\nFriends of his werent so lucky. Just after midnight on June 13th, 2007, officers from the LAPDs Southeast Division responded to a domestic-violence call on East 120th Street, about five minutes from Lamars house. There, they found his good friend D.T. allegedly holding a 10-inch knife. According to police, D.T. charged, and an officer opened fire, killing him. It never really quite added up, Lamar says. But heres the crazy thing. Normally when we find out somebody got killed, the first thing we say is Who did it? Where we gotta go? Its a gang altercation. But this time it was the police - the biggest gang in California. Youll never win against them.\nOn an otherwise positive song called Hiiipower, from his 2011 mixtape Section.80, Lamar rapped, I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol/Aim it at a pig, Charlottes Web is going to miss you. Its an unsettling line, especially coming from a rapper who often subverts gangster tropes but rarely trafficks in them. I was angry, he says. To be someone with a good heart, and to still be harassed as a kid...it took a toll on me. Soon youre just saying, Fuck everything. That line was me getting those frustrations out. And Im glad I could get them out with a pen and a paper.\nAbout three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to death in a Florida subdivision. It just put a whole new anger inside me, Lamar says. It made me remember how I felt. Being harassed, my partners being killed. He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, The Blacker the Berry:Coming from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big\nMy nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, dont you?\nYou hate my people\nYour plan is to terminate my culture...But as soon as Lamar wrote, he also started thinking about his own time in the streets and all the wrong Ive done. So he started writing a new verse, in which he turned the microscope on himself. How can he criticize America for killing young black men, he asks, when young black men are often just as good at it? As the songs narrator put it, Why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street/When gangbanging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?/Hypocrite\nWhen it was finally released last month, the song sparked a rash of think pieces, with some listeners saying Lamar was ignoring the real problem: the systemic racism that created the conditions for black-on-black crime in the first place. Coupled with a recent Billboard interview in which Lamar seemed to suggest that some of the responsibility for preventing killings like that of Michael Brown lay with black people themselves, some fans thought he sounded like a right-wing apologist. The rapper Azealia Banks called his comments the dumbest shit Ive ever heard a black man say.\nLamar says hes not an idiot. I know the history, he says. Im not talking about that. Im talking from a personal standpoint. Im talking about gangbanging\nHe grew up surrounded by gangs. Some of his close friends were West Side Pirus, a local Blood affiliate, and his mom says her brothers were Compton Crips. One of his uncles did a 15-year stretch for robbery, and another is locked up now for the same; his Uncle Tony, meanwhile, was shot in the head at a burger stand when kendrick was a boy. But Lamar says he was taught that change starts from within. My moms always told me: How long you gonna play the victim? he says. I can say Im mad and I hate everything, but nothing really changes until I change myself. So no matter how much bullshit weve been through as a community, Im strong enough to say fuck that, and acknowledge myself and my own struggles.\nWhen Lamar released the new albums first single, i, last September, many fans werent sure what to make of it. A blast of pop positivity that samples an Isley Brothers hit recently heard soundtracking a Swiffer commercial, it felt like an odd move for Lamar, whos known for more complex fare. People called it corny, mocked its feel-good, Happy-style chorus . I know people might think that means Im conceited or something, Lamar says. No. It means Im depressed.\nLamar is sitting in the Santa Monica recording studio where he made much of his new album, dressed in a charcoal sweatsuit and Reeboks. His baseball cap is pulled low over his sprouting braids, and he speaks softly and thoughtfully, with long pauses between sentences\nIve woken up in the morning and felt like shit, he says. Feeling guilty. Feeling angry. Feeling regretful. As a kid from Compton, you can get all the success in the world and still question your worth.\nLamar says he intended i as a Keep Ya Head Up-style message for his friends in the penitentiary. But he also wrote it for himself, to ward off dark thoughts. My partner Jason Estrada told me, If you dont attack it, it will attack you, Lamar says. If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, its gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. Its a reminder. It makes me feel good.\nLamar also points out that the fans who scratched their heads at i had yet to hear u - its counterpoint on the album. i is the answer to u, he says. The latter is four and a half minutes of devastating honesty, with Lamar almost sopping over a discordant beat, berating himself about his lack of confidence and calling himself a fucking failure. Its the sound of a man staring into the mirror and hating what he sees, punctuated by a self-aware hook: Loving you is complicated.\nThat was one of the hardest songs I had to write, he says. Theres some very dark moments in there. All my insecurities and selfishness and letdowns. That shit is depressing as a motherfucker. But it helps, though, he says. It helps.\nLamar has documented his inner struggles before, most notably on Swimming Pools, from good kid, which explores his past troubles with alcohol and his familys history of addiction. But once he got successful, he says, things got more difficult, not less. One of his biggest issues was self esteem - accepting that he deserved to be where he was. And some of that came from his discomfort around white people\nIm going to be 100 percent real with you, Lamar says. In all my days of schooling, from preschool all the way up to 12th grade, there was not one white person in my class. Literally zero. Before he started touring, he had barely left Compton; when he finally did, the culture shock threw him. Imagine only discovering that when youre 25, Lamar says. Youre around people you dont know how to communicate with. You dont speak the same lingo. It brings confusion and insecurity. Questioning how did I get here, what am I doing? That was a cycle I had to break quick. But at the same time, youre excited, because youre in a different environment. The world keeps going outside the neighborhood.\nThe week good kid was released, Lamar began keeping a diary. It really came from the conversations I had with Dre, he says. Hearing him tell stories about all these moments, and how it went by like that - he snaps. I didnt want to forget how I was feeling when my album dropped, or when I went back to Compton.\nLamar ended up filling multiple notebooks. Theres a lot of weird shit in there, he says. Lot of drawings, visuals. Where as good kid was an exercise in millennial nostalgia, To Pimp a Butterfly is firmly in the present. Its his take on what it means to be young and black in America today - and more specifically, what it means to be Kendrick Lamar, navigating success, expectation and his own self-doubt\nMusically, the album - at least the half that hes comfortable sharing so far - is adventurous, borrowing from free jazz and 1970s funk. Lamar says he listened to a lot of Miles Davis and Parliament. His producer Mark Sounwave Spears, whos known Lamar since he was 16, says, Every producer Ive ever met was sending me stuff - but there was a one-in-a-million chance you could send us a beat that actually fit what we were doing. Ali says Lamar works synesthetically - He talks in colors all the time: Make it sound purple. Make it sound light green.\nBut of all the albums colors, the most prominent is black. There are allusions to the entire sweep of African-American history, from the dispora to the cotton fields to the Harlem renaissance to Obama. Mortal Man name-checks leaders from Mandela to MLK all the way back to moses. On King Kunta, a stomping blast of James Brown funk, he imagines himself as the titular slave from Roots, shouting the punchline Everybody wanna cut the legs off him!/Black man taking no losses!\nHanging over it all, of course, are the tragedies of the past three years: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice. Says Sounwave, To me, the album is perfect for right now. If the world was happy, maybe wed give you a happy album. But right now, we are not happy.\nLamar - who calls the album fearful, honest and unapologetic - is coy about what the title means. Just putting the word pimp next to butterfly... he says, then laughs. Its a trip. Thats something that will be a phrase forever. Itll be taught in college courses - I truly believe that. I ask if hes the pimp or the butterfly, and he just smiles. I could be both, he says\nOn the last day of February, Lamar and two dozen loved ones are gathered at a $6 million mansion in Calabasas, for a surprise birthday party for Sounwave. The estate belongs to Top Dawg Tiffeth, part of a group of properties so exclusive theyre protected by two security gates, the second presumably to keep out the riff-raff inhabiting the mansions inside the first. NBA star Paul Pierce lives across the street, and multiple Kardashians live around the block. Theres probably a million dollars in this driveway, says Lamars tour manager, a friendly dude named retOne, as he surveys the Audis, Benzes and Range Rovers out front\nLamar lives down the coast with his longtime girlfriend, Whitney , in a tri-level condo he rents in the South Bay, on the water. He still hasnt splurged on much: So far his biggest purchase is a relatively modest house in the suburbs east of L.A., which he bought for his parents more than a year ago. Top Dawg says that at first his mom didnt want to take it, because it meant giving up their Section 8 status. Kendrick had to reassure her: Its OK, Mom. Were good. \nIn the kitchen, the girls are snacking and chatting, while the guys are in the home theater watching the new Kobe documentary. In the dining room, Lamar is talking to Sounwave and his manager Dave Free, trying to make last-minute changes to the record thats due out in two weeks\nEventually, Whitney comes in and rests her hand on Lamars shoulder. Theyre about the blow out the candles, she says. Everyone moves into the kitchen to sing Happy Birthday to Sounwave, and Lamar stands beside Whitney, his arm around her waist. They look happy. Sounwave is about to blow out the candles when someone tells him to make a wish - but before he can, Lamar jumps in and makes one for him. I wish, he says, smiling, for hot beats!", "Now everybody sing that shit\nJohnny always lock a nigga down\nKnowing damn well we dont wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao\nLittle nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac\nIn his prime, thug life is now on radar\nTil the federal come through and raid ours\nReminiscing when the LA Raiders\nWas in my home, snapback fitted on my uncles dome\nSnapback fitted\nSnapback fitted\nSnapback fitted\nOn my uncles dome\nAnd I dont condone dickriding, Im addicted to\nWestsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die\nAnd the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion\nTrying, and I mean that shit\nGame came through, put the city on his back\nI was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit\nCompton!, a nigga gotta scream that shit\nNever went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit\nCant block or screen that shit\nCant block or\nCant block or\nCant block or\nScreen that shit\nCant block or screen that shit\nNow everybody sing that shit\nNow everybody sing that shit\nIm addicted to\nWestsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die\nAnd the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion\nTrying, and I mean that shit\nGame came through, put the city on his back\nI was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit\nScream that shit\nNever went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit\nCant block or screen that shit\nCant block or\nCant block or\nCant block or\nScreen that shit\nCant block or screen that shit\nNow everybody sing that shit", "All the spoons in my kitchen\nBend ya up, and bend ya back down\nAll the girls in my bedroom\nBend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out\nAll the rules to this game, oh I\nBend it girl, bend it girl\nUh, Soon as I enter\nI put a hurting on it\nIf I don’t kill it she injured\nFor a Long time\nSummer, spring and winter\nFall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga\nJumping off the boat in some 87 Locs\nShe’s seen them hundred spokes\nAnd then that woman spoke\nBut I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks\nIf that don’t work put your wife on track\nShow me where the candle wax\nIt must be you, cuz I burn right through\nEverything ya’ll do\nHigh octane when I bring on my last name\nMr. Lamar AKA “The Cash King\nQuicker than pre-cum won’t you give her a reason;\nTo not meet up with me like a vegan\nPsssst!

They’re not understanding that it’s not about the culture, it’s not about what side we on, it’s about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced… I feel like I’m a student.

At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where they’re at. But I can’t stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.\nOn East/West rivalry in 2013:\nI feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No that’s old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture. My first sold out show was in New York…I respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, I’m gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it.

What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?” Nobody ever really asks about what it’s like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can’t make a song like “i” without being in that dark place. “i” comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, “Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life.” Or “I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show.”\nI believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn’t so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it’s a whole different story to me. That’s when I learned that while I’m making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that’s spooky\nI think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term “role model.” You would say, “I don’t wanna be a role model. I don’t want none of that.” But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It’s impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don’t get a response like, “Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?” Or, “I wanna just take this picture with you.” No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is somethingWhen I try to soak it all in, that’s the only thing that kind’ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I’m meeting these different people every day. It kind’ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain’t that important when you meeting somebody that’s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, “Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.” And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it’s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see itAnything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word “famous.” I’m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it’s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others\nI had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, “Try to completely throw away your ego.” How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It’s tough. It’s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it’s all for your ego. It’s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I’m somebody. But truthfully, you’ve always been somebody. You don’t need the lights\nI try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what’s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I’m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can’t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things\nIt’s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it’s not just me you’re focusing on now when I’m out in public, but also on individual characters that I’m talking about in my music. So that’s a whole other ballgame and it’s just something that I’ve gotta acceptWhen I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it’s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom’s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I’d never think that would happen, but it’s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can’t drive that thing no more. And she’s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day. It’s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it’s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it\nI’d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I’m finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it’s a whole other perspective and light, I’ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and ’Pac did it. And I’ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what’s on the radio right now? I don’t think they doin’ skits and things like that.” I don’t know if the people are gonna understand what I’m talkin’ about on this album because it’s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain’t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least\nMy whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don’t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn’t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don’t know. Y’all sure I’m right?”\nI was nervous because I didn’t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it’s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.”I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family\nBecause that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that’s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn’t satisfied. I’m looking around like, this is great security, but I don’t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that’s in need. But at the same time, I’m feeling like, okay, what’s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyricsKendrick Lamar - Bitch, Dont Kill My Vibe (I think the first time I played “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I’m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can’t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I’m gonna be influenced and I don’t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it’s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It’s selfishness for sure, but it’s my selfishness and I own it\nI know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret. That’s how I was feeling at the time and that’s how y’all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that’s how I look at itFrom 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper’s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin’ barbarian. That’s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper ’cause this is around the same time where cats weren’t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn’t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that’s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer’s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that’s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It’s the art of writingSo you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I’m obsessed with it. And that’s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I’m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That’s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that’s something that I hold dear\nWhen I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn’t tamper with, I’ve already had done, that’s when I’m done and I know I’ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I’m drawn away from it, that’s when I say, okay, let’s take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let’s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear\nIt’s the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don’t just play records for people—you won’t necessarily get it until it’s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I’m not an artist that’s gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album’s gonna sound like, go sell it.” That’s not me. I’m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that’s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don’t want to jump in somebody else’s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I’m inspired\nWhat’s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there’s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don’t necessarily scare me. It’s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.”\nThank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my backI thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn’t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn’t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you’re saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep\nI found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It’s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I’m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like thatWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?” It’s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it’s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don’t necessarily change, it’s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don’t care about them or you don’t fuck with them no more when that’s not the case. You’re just more focused on what you have to do because it’s biggerThe moment I start seeing change in people around me, that’s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there’s tension in the air that I probably can’t necessarily deal with at the moment. ’Cause when the industry don’t understand me, and the business don’t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can’t run to them?\nArtists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I’m always paranoid. I’m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you’re put into a space where you feel like you can’t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day\nThe hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It’s almost like you go on the road and you’re gone for two years. And this place you’ve known your whole life, these people you’ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that’s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don’t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being\nWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I’ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I’m saying this right now to let everyone know, it’s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity", "When the lights shut off, an artists dream is that their work will stand the test of time. The ones that influence our culture are the ones we most remember. Here, two powerful creative forces come together to elevate the status quo and lay ground to their legacy. This is their poetry.

At the top, in black capital letters, it reads: “IF YOU NOT THE HOMIE, DON’T COME IN HERE.” At the bottom, in red letters: “DISREGARD THIS AND GET THE TIPS PUT ON YOU, HOMIE.”\nThe reason for the caution: On any given day, Kendrick Lamar might be in deep concentration working on the follow-up to his 2012 major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city. GKMC was more than a great album; it was a landmark event, a modern masterpiece to rival Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle. It’s an artistically ambitious, highly personal piece of work: a day in the young artist’s life, encompassing gang culture in his Compton hometown, alcohol, drugs, life, death, God, family, and the pursuit of a girl named Sherane, a “concept album” that managed to sell over 1.2 million copies while making zero creative concessions. It transformed Kendrick from an Internet sensation into an A-list rap star\nThe success of GKMC in 2012, along with Ab-Soul’s Control System and ScHoolboy Q’s Habits & Contradictions, made TDE—launched in 1997 out of Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith’s home studio in Carson, Calif.—the hottest new rap label around. With TDE, Odd Future, YG, DJ Mustard, Nipsey Hussle, and others all popping, L.A. has been reestablished as a vibrant rap city. The renaissance shows no signs of slowing this year, with acclaimed releases like YG’s My Krazy Life, ScHoolboy Q’s Oxymoron, and Ab-Soul’s These Days.... Still, GKMC remains the crowning achievement\n“When I went back to my old high school, all these kids looking at me like I’m the real big homie, the same way I look at Jay Z, Nas, or Dr. Dre,” says Kendrick with a laugh, sitting in his luxury trailer at his Complex cover shoot. “You would’ve thought Michael Jackson walked through that joint off the excitement that they had.”But now that Kendrick, 27, is a hysteria-inducing star, the world is waiting to see if he can deliver twice. Expectations are high. After good kid, good simply won’t be good enough. Unlike GKMC, which Kendrick planned years in advance, there’s no cover art in mind for the follow-up. As for a title, Kendrick says he’s “flirting with ideas.” He’s been working primarily with TDE’s in-house producers, Tae Beast and Sounwave of Digi+Phonics, but has also gotten in the studio with Dr. Dre. He’s still just “getting his ideas down,” but so far Kendrick’s recorded 30 to 40 new songs for the album . He says he’ll be ready for a fourth quarter release\n“Good kid set the bar,” says Terrence “Punch” Henderson, president of TDE and the crew’s resident rap history buff. “Today, that’s the album that you gotta compare your album to. Illmatic would be the comparison—it didn’t sell the most records, but that was the standard.”\nIt’s the cornerstone of Nas’ legacy, but Illmatic was both a gift and a curse. Critics and fans alike compare all of Nas’ subsequent albums to his 1994 debut and are never quite satisfied. Ditto for Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, DMX, Slick Rick, and other rap greats who burst out of the gate with classic albums. Although other legends—including Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Kendrick’s Interscope labelmate Eminem—delivered strong second albums that arguably surpassed their first efforts, creating a worthy follow-up is one of rap’s greatest challenges\n“Kendrick shook up the rap game, so anticipation for his second offering is through the roof,” says Nas. “Kendrick’s an album guy and the album artist has a whole different kind of value. Kendrick is going to be one of the most important writers of our time; dude’s a rhyming animal. Whatever he does will be appreciated, but at the same time he knows he has to bring it.”\nKendrick says there’s less pressure on him now than there was right before good kid came out, when he was admittedly “super nervous.” “I was on the tour bus going back and forth on the text with Pharrell,” says Kendrick. “I asked him, ‘You think they gon’ get it?’ And he told me, ‘Don’t ever doubt yourself again. Always be aware but don’t ever mistake your first mind, your input of where your heart is at.’”\nToday Kendrick trusts that his creative process will lead him where he needs to go. “If I keep focusing on, ‘I need to make something better than good kid,’ it’s going to be just that,” says Kendrick. “That’s not challenging yourself. I don’t want to become that person reflecting on what has been done. What I’m doing now is the question. I’m only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.”To fully appreciate the impact of GKMC, consider the context it was released in. Of the 10 biggest rap hits of 2012, two were by Flo Rida, two featured Nicki Minaj rapping over EDM-style production , and one was “Gangnam Style.” For better or worse, Kendrick’s Interscope labelmate Chief Keef had become a scapegoat for a perceived decline in rap lyrics and the fetishizing of ghetto violence by the media. Weeks before GKMC dropped, rap news was dominated by fights between G-Unit and MMG’s camps at the BET Awards\nOnce GKMC sold 242,122 copies its first week, became the best reviewed rap album on Metacritic since Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and discussions about the classic status of the album hit a fevered pitch, Kendrick morphed from a promising rapper to the face of “real hip-hop.” Not just because of his artistic achievement, but because his celebrity relied solely on his musical output—not beef, fashion choices, business ventures, or the other gimmicks that have seemingly become part of the standard package for nearly every rapper\nAfter the album’s release, Kendrick’s life was a whirlwind of tour dates and unexpected controversies. He toured non-stop in 2013, playing college campuses, festivals, opening for Kanye West on the Yeezus tour, and going on the good kid, m.A.A.d city world tour. During his tour, as he traveled from Sweden to Belgium with little Internet connection, Kendrick Lamar unintentionally set the rap world on fireOn the night of August 12, 2013, Big Sean released the Kendrick Lamar and Jay Electronica–assisted “Control”—a song meant for Sean’s album, Hall of Fame, but left off due to sample clearance issues. On Lamar’s earth-shattering verse he called himself the King of New York, a claim he shies away from now: “I feel B.I.G. and Jay will always be the King of New York.” More important, Lamar called out nearly every rapper in his generation—from A$AP Rocky to J. Cole and even Big Sean and Jay Electronica—and claimed, “I got love for you all but I’m tryna murder you niggas.”\nBy the next day, “Control” had taken on a life of its own. Instagram was overrun with “Control” memes, storm clouds of rap debates gathered, and thinkpieces poured out—even legendary NBA coach Phil Jackson, who was mentioned in the verse, got in the mix, tweeting at Kendrick. Just about every rapper, whether they were mentioned in the song or not, commented on the verse or dropped a response track. TMZ ran up on any rapper they could find, trying to goad them into responding. The week of the song’s release, Kendrick picked up 208,000 new Twitter followers\nRappers are supposed to want to best each other—“I’m better than him” sums up rap’s competitive mantra. But “Control” proved something contemporary philosopher Slavoj Žižek once argued about Wikileaks, what he calls “the paradox of public space”: “Even if everyone knows an unpleasant fact, saying it in public changes everything.” By naming names, Kendrick’s verse was the moment he asserted his dominance in rap. Earlier that year MTV had named Lamar the Hottest MC and Complex declared him the Best Rapper Alive; “Control” was when Lamar’s status as the best coalescedIm only as good as my last word, my last hook, my last bridge.One rapper Kendrick didn’t mention in his “Control” verse was Macklemore. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, Macklemore’s The Heist beat Kendrick’s GKMC for Best Rap Album. Although Kendrick was nominated for seven awards, he went home empty handed, while Macklemore won Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap Performance. For fans on Twitter and members of the media , Macklemore’s wins and Kendrick’s snubs served as a watershed moment for cultural appropriation in rap. To make matters worse, Macklemore Instagramed an apologetic text he sent to Kendrick after the awards that read, “I robbed you.”\n“It wasn’t really a huge deal for me,” says Kendrick, who’s known Macklemore for over a year. “Macklemore deserves the accolades. That’s still my partner regardless. He probably didn’t need to Instagram the text. But what’s done is done.”\nLike Macklemore’s success, Kendrick’s comes after years on the independent grind. In 2003, when he was 16, Kendrick dropped his first mixtape under the moniker K-Dot. He released three more mixtapes before reverting to his government name and dropping the Kendrick Lamar EP in 2009. Over the next two years, with his mixtape Overly Dedicated and his independently released first album, Section.80, he found the voice that made GKMC a classic. But Kendrick’s acuity with words predates his musical output“My first-grade teacher flipped out because I wrote the word ‘audacity’ in a story,” he recalls. “I knew the word only because I heard my auntie and uncles arguing, saying, ‘You got the audacity to take my motherfucking drink and pour it out?!’ I learned all my words like that, so when I went to school it was in my head.”\nKendrick’s perspective on life always comes back to his Compton roots. His upbringing provides him with a treasure trove of traumatic experiences that give his music a sense of purpose. On the lyrical blackout “m.A.A.d city,” he describes seeing a “light-skin nigga with his brains blown out.” Around age 5, he witnessed his uncle’s murder. In conversation, he casually recalls yet another murder, when he called his friend Yo to the barbershop just before someone shot up the block, killing one of their homeboys\nGKMC apparently only scratched the surface of the stories Kendrick has to tell. “There were so many things I thought he was gonna talk about in good kid that he didn’t,” says Kendrick’s manager Dave Free, who remembers the days when K-Dot couldn’t be spotted with a backpack, lest he be labeled a conscious rapper. “All these other stories, shit that will blow your brain, have never been heard before because they’re just too personal. There’s still so much to be said. The question is, is he gonna say it?”\nWhether or not Kendrick tells those stories could go a long way toward determining if he’ll be able to top his major label debut. “I got a greater purpose,” he says. “God put something in my heart to get across and that’s what I’m going to focus on, using my voice as an instrument and doing what needs to be done.” The only place to do that is back in the studioFor a few hours, Kendrick can forget about his next album. He’s back in Studio 2 working on a guest verse for Jay Rock’s upcoming album. According to Dave, a typical Kendrick guest verse costs $250,000. They once charged $400,000. He’s had some of his best moments on other people’s songs: trading bars with Eminem on “Love Game,” introducing an R&B flow on Robin Thicke’s “Give It 2 U,” stealing the show on A$AP Rocky’s star-studded “Fuckin’ Problems”—a song originally made for GKMC but given away because it didn’t fit the narrative arc of the album\nKendrick gets to the studio at 3 p.m. and sits on a black couch in the lounge area playing Jay Rock tracks on his MacBook. He sports a navy blue Detroit Tigers hat, white T, gray sweats, and, for the third day in a row, a pair of blue Nike Roshe Runs with white polka dots. A gold and black painting of Snoop Dogg, with the lyrics to “Murder Was the Case” inscribed in cursive, hangs behind him. He turns the TV to an episode of South Park but keeps the volume down and doesn’t even glance at the screen. Eyes fixed upon his computer, he listens to the music with his elbows on his thighs and his fingers interlocked. He rarely blinksAfter about 15 minutes in the lounge, he moves into the studio and connects his laptop to the speakers, playing Jay Rock’s verse over and over, flipping around tracks, and sipping from a bottle of water. Later he’ll chomp on an order of volcano salmon sushi. He tends to eat healthy—salads, baked chicken, lots of water. He plays basketball twice a week because, as Jay Z once said, rapping is “like an exercise.” And unlike many rappers—including his TDE labelmates ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul—he rarely drinks and doesn’t smoke or sip lean. All the homies know not to bother him when he’s busy in the lab. Sometimes he kicks everyone out of the studio so he can play instrumentals all night long, alone. He’s been known to cut off his phone for months at a timeGod put something in my heart to get across and thats what Im going to focus onPunch describes Kendrick as a “mad scientist” in the studio, but watching him at work, nothing seems erratic. If anything, he’s supremely calculating; the song slowly builds as his process unfolds. Kendrick stands around mumble-rapping to himself with his right index finger extended, like he’s pointing out each syllable as if it passes by on an imaginary teleprompter. He scribbles his verse on a small notepad that sits above a mic compressor. After about an hour, his verse is written. He takes a break, checks his email, and chats in the studio a bit before grabbing a studio engineer and getting to work. The engineer dims the lights and starts looping up the beat. Kendrick hums the verse to himself a few more times before he’s ready to rock. Then he heads around the corner to the boothIn the booth, Kendrick is a case study in precision. He raps with his eyes closed and his hands out as if he’s casting a spell, rapping about “restricted territories” and “Percocet headaches.” On the first few takes, his voice sounds closer to his normal speaking voice than his agitated extraterrestrial rapping voice. He’s rhyming slower than usual, taking his time to enunciate each line. After about five takes, he steps out of the booth and returns to the pad and paper he left on the compressor. He edits the verse on paper, scratching out some lines and writing new ones. But when he goes back to the booth, he leaves the paper behind“In the past, he never wrote down anything,” explains Sounwave, who produced “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe.” “Every now and then he’ll write down stuff, just for insurance purposes. He rehearses the song over and over in his head so he can get the full feeling.”\nKendrick returns to the booth and slams the door shut. He does a couple more takes but keeps flubbing one line halfway through the verse. He steps back and paces around the booth, repeating the lines over and over as he internalizes the verse’s structure. Then he looks up and says, “All right, let’s get it.” That’s when Derek “MixedByAli” Ali, Kendrick’s regular engineer, walks in and takes over\n“Watching Kendrick is like watching a master chess player playing five games at one time,” says Ali. “He can do five songs in one day. He’ll start one song, then he’ll be like, ‘I’ma start on this.’ ‘I’ma go back to the old song.’ ‘I’ma start on this.’ There’s just so much going on in his head.”When Im in the studio Im looking for a feeling I havent felt. Its a high.Back in the booth, Kendrick is close to his 10th take. He hasn’t perfected it yet—some takes have better cadence, others have better breath control. He repeats the process over and over to pinpoint exactly what he wants. “Keep that one,” he tells Ali, “I’ma do one more.” After about a dozen takes, his voice opens up and his words start to crackle. He blurts the word “bitch” into the mic with the spontaneity and violence of a sneeze\n“It’s not like, ‘Watch me get it in one take,’” says Sounwave. “It’s like, ‘Watch me get the best take.’ Sometimes we have a song complete and he’s like, ‘Nah, my tone on that.... Redo the whole thing.’ He redoes it and it’s like a different song now just because of the tone that he switched up.”\nAfter 30 minutes and 15 takes, Kendrick proclaims that the mic is “hot,” ready to catch his voice perfectly. Having used a light mix for reference initially while he figured out his vision, he asks Ali to give him a live mix, which sounds closer to the completed version, in his headphonesKendrick’s idea of what this verse should be is coming to fruition. Each take is sharper. He’s getting more animated in the booth, his head jerking as he screeches past each word. After about the 20th take, he’s satisfied enough to hop out of the booth to review. He keeps editing the paper but casually remarks that he’s done. It’s 5 p.m. and he’s on to the next\nLike the human distractions Kendrick keeps out with a sign on the studio door, he doesn’t let fear enter his creative space. “This is truly a blessing from a higher power,” Kendrick says, “and as long as I understand that there’s really no limitations to what I can do. Everything is forward with me. When I’m in the studio I’m looking for creativity I haven’t matched yet, a feeling I haven’t felt. It’s a high. When you look at people like Jay Z, Nas, Dr. Dre, these people are established, but they love music and they love that high. You always want that feeling of creativity.” And with that, Kendrick Lamar politely excuses himself. He’s got work to do", "We have a very special episode of Outside the Lines With Rap Genius for you.

You’re like a little backpack rapper, and then all of a sudden TMZ cares about what you’re doing.\nKL: That world is The Matrix. I don’t understand that world—that’s The Matrix.\nXXL: Is it really like they say, that it happens fast? Even though you’re moving real slow and then—\nKL: Yeah, that’s very true. That’s very true. It definitely happens fast, but not fast in the sense, saying you didn’t put in the work—I’ve been doing this for ten years—but when that light beams on you, it happens fast from an aspect where you’re doing so much every day you’re not really aware of the attention that you’re getting, ’cause you’re doing interviews, you do a show, then you do a studio, it’s just a constant, daily plan, so you can’t look at yourself. You can’t be in the crowd looking at yourself on stage, you know. I can only look in the mirror and know I’m Kendrick, and see that same little boy I seen seven years , but I can’t see what everyone else sees. So more and more, I’m really unfazed by it as more and more success is hitting me and I’m not really sure .

Where are you at, as an artist?\nKL: I’ve been on the road for the most part. But at the same time I gotta stay creative, I gotta stay writing—I’m usually writing every day. I can’t miss a day without writing, whether it’s a line, a verse, or an idea. I always have to have that creative flow going.\nXXL: When you say you write, what’s your writing process like? Are you writing or are you just thinking shit in your mind?\nKL: The process for my first album, my debut album, and even music prior to that, it’s always been like 50/50. I have some songs where I just went in the booth and just got the thoughts off and I didn’t want to feel like I was confined with a sheet of paper. Some records, I may sit with it and have scraps of napkins everywhere, and papers everywhere scattered, then piecing up them ideas together and putting them to songs.

The albums cover art, a grubby Polaroid, provides a visual prompt for the scene: Baby Kendrick dangles off an uncles knee in front of a squat kitchen table displaying a 40-ounce and Lamars baby bottle. The snapshot is such an unvarnished peek into the rappers inner life that staring at it for too long feels almost invasive. This autobiographical intensity is the albums calling card. Listening to it feels like walking directly into Lamars childhood home and, for the next hour, growing up alongside him.\nLamar has subtitled the record A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar, and the comparison rings true: You could take the albums outline and build a set for a three-act play. It opens on a 17-year-old Kendrick with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental, driving his mothers van to see a girl named Sherane. As his voice darts and halts in a rhythm that mimics his over-eager commute, Lamar explores the furtiveness of young lust: Its deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb, he raps. The song is interrupted by the first of several voice mail recordings that delineate the albums structure: Kendricks mother, rambling into his phone and pleading for him to return her car. These voicemails appear through the record, reinforcing that good kid, m.A.A.d city is partly a love letter to the grounding power of family. In this albums world, family and faith are not abstract concepts: They are the fraying tethers holding Lamar back from the chasm of gang violence that threatens to consume him.\nAll this weighty material might make good kid, m.A.A.d city sound like a bit of a drag. But the miracle of this album is how it ties straightforward rap thrills-- dazzling lyrical virtuosity, slick quotables, pulverizing beats, star turns from guest rappers-- directly to its narrative. For example, when Backseat Freestyle leaked last week, its uncharacteristic subject matter took some fans by surprise. But on the album, it marks the moment in the narrative when young Kendricks character first begins rapping, egged on by a friend who plugs in a beat CD. Framed this way, his damn, I got bitches chant gets turned inside out: This isnt an alpha males boast. Its a pipsqueaks first pass at a chest-puff. Its also a monster of a radio-ready single, with Kendrick rapping in three voices over an insane Hit-Boy beat.\nLamar grew up in Compton, and ghosts of West Coast gangsta-rap haunt this albums edges, casting shadows on Kendricks complicated relationship with his hometown. When The Art of Peer Pressure brings Kendrick and his friends to Rosecrans Ave., the music downshifts into menacing G-funk mode as a salute to hallowed ground. Ice Cube’s “Bird in the Hand” is invoked to set up “m.A.A.d city” , which appropriately marks the moment when real violence erupts. Here, Kendrick sounds like a terrified kid: I made a promise to see you bleeding, he raps, his voice pitched at a pleading, near-hysterical sob. In response, the voice of Comptons Most Wanted rapper MC Eiht leers, Wake yo punk ass up, like a father figure of the Darth Vader variety.\nWhich brings us to the albums most visible benefactor and most unsettled presence: Dr. Dre. In recent months, Dre has availed himself of the fresh-career oxygen Kendricks rise has pumped into his atmosphere, lumbering out of his corporate airlock to stand with Lamar on magazine covers. But the role he plays in Lamars story feels muddled and unresolved. On an album that manages to seamlessly work a smirking Drake and a highly recognizable Janet Jackson sample into the fabric of a larger narrative, it is only Dres appearance, on the final track Compton, that feels like an uneasy outlier.\nCompton is the victory lap, the coronation. Coming after the stunning 12-minute denouement Sing About Me, Im Dying of Thirst, in which Lamar delivers a verse from a peripheral character that is the albums most dazzling stroke of empathy, it cant help but be a small deflation. The moment of arrival in any artists story is always less interesting than their journey, and theres a disconnect in hearing Lamar and Dre stunt over Just Blazes blaring orchestral-soul beat. Dres music is part of the landscape that Kendrick grew up in but his actual appearance has a certain Truman Show feel to it.\nBut the true ending of good kid, m.A.A.d. city takes place at the end of the previous song, Real, which represents the spiritual victory that the albums story has thrashed its way towards. Finally grasping that none of that shit-- money, power, respect, loving your block-- make me real, Lamar embraces what does, as his parents put the albums central concerns to bed: Any nigga can kill a man, his father admonishes. That dont make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. And his mother: If I dont hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man... Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton... When you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement. And thats the best way to give back to your city. And I love you, Kendrick.\n9.5/", "If you want some you can get some\nWe can do it with the small or the big guns\nBout Whatever and whenever you want to do with this war shit we used to it\nLets get it on\nAw shit rock stepped in the place\nYou know he got somn’ on his waist\nTwo niggas beside him yeah they got something on their waist and they’ll let it spray if he say\nAnd Fade away like a J multiple shots for your face\nLeft the Proof for the highlight tape for the FOX 11 ?

the porches\nThese boys out here peddlin’ porcelain to the less fortunate\nWe knee deep in the bride of the four horsemen\nCan’t tell the trees from where the forest is\nMore coffins filled with good lookin’ corpses\nThe Nickerson Gardens is like a graveyard, braveheart cemeteries\nSeventh grade school picture on the cover of the obituary\nI wrote it in my scrolls, literary student, a visionary nuisance\nThe voice of the movement, peep out the window, articulate confusion\nThe YGs raise the baby thugs like soldiers\nTeach ‘em to run spots and throw ‘em from the shoulder\nShooters, gun toters, the older ones control them like MK ULTRA\nViolence, the code of silence, baby girl wylin’, she got a thousand problems\nShe do hair and sell dope out of the same housing, she be too busy mouthing\nIn everybody business, the first one to start singing faced with a sentence\nSection 8 tenants, the black and white buildings, parole violators, government assistance\nGR recipients, collect checks and hit licks, they sleeping with two bricks\nSold them wholesale to a snitch\nThey caught him on camera, promised him a sweet deal if he flipped\nPlus they got him with the hammers, gun powder residue\nThat’s what I seen out my project window\nLet it run, Q\nIf I die tomorrow my city would come with me now\nI swear the sky will fall\nIt’s only fair that I warn ya out in California\nIt ain’t safe to wear less than armor\nBut event the night fall when the day break is draped in smog\nShorty got longer arms than the law\nThinking he could box with God\nYou catch an onslaught even at breakfast, think is hard\nPause, yeah, they bake on bake meaning the couch\nYoung nigga shoot back and watch and hit everybody\nCause everybody ain’t affiliated\nWhether you active or faking, it’s part of the demographic\nThat’s what’s fueling my hatred for the inner city\nBlues, this music when them tools clatchin’\nKids get to answer questions in their middle school classes\nCan’t recite a rap classic verbatim\nTake 36 ounces, break ‘em down without weighing them\nWe can’t pay ‘em the attention crime paying ‘em\nThe ‘jects raise us to raise guns, the day ones\nWhen them raids come, just play dumb, don’t say nothing\nDo the bidding, spray and blend in, take the fade\nEducate yourself, read up on the case\n80% time served, 40k flipped the bird\nRead the terms of your probation\nHe ain’t listen, he’d rather kick it with no henchmen\nGang conjunction, that’s violation, no more smiling faces\nThat’s the basis of what’s facing the younger generation\nNo more Reaganomics, just Obama’s promise\nGot me sick to my stomach, make me want to vomit\nA vicious cycle in rotation like the chronic\nThey light the chronic, sip the Henny, load the hollows in the semi\nPull it back until it’s empty on the enemy\nThat looks like them, self-hatred is a rare gem\nGet out the water if you can’t swim\nIf I die tomorrow my city would come with me now\nI swear the sky will fall\nSo you can

motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I aint been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I aint seen yall in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people thats been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. Thatd said album of the year, that said album of this generation and all that shit. Thats cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what Im saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that youre great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but its hard because youre institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. Im a low-key nigga. And I aint scared of the world. Me personally, I cant run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I dont need to, I dont want to. And thats just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it cant cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, I need to be me goddamnit. I think this shit can live forever, but looking at yall faces yall just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world . I could talk all day . To Pimp a Butterfly. Yall allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Yall allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what Im saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what Im saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit.

No - just - niggas used to roll down Rosecrans, we used to be bumpin that - pops used to be bumpin that NWA shit. And, uh, shit - you know, cruise down that street in my 6-4. We wasnt in no 6-4 though. We was in the brown dukie van and shit, same color as dukie\nKnow what Im talkin bout? But uh, yeah, wed bump that shit all day\nOh, okay. And what influenced you to become, you know, a rapper?\nYou know, the typical person would say, uh, other rappers. Imma be straight up honest, when I found out I was dope - Next question...", "So you’re performing in Brixton on Monday, what happens at one of your live shows?\nCraziness. A lot of energy, a lot of energy from myself and the crowd\nHow do you feel in front of a crowd?\nI feel at peace, you know. It’s a way to express yourself, a way to vent, put all your emotions out on that stage\nWhere was your first ever gig?\nMy first ever was at a hole in the wall place, in a small city, in a small club in Los Angeles\nWhat happened?\nI was probably terrible.. But it was a growing experience, a growing process, and you know, you never forget those moments\nWho was the first person to tell you that you were good at music?\nThe first person to tell me was probably this guy named Dave Free, he’s my manager now, since I was like tenth grade...yeah\nHow did he discover you?\nThrough a mutual friend, it was all in high school, rapping and stuff. And then a mutual friend told him about me and we decided to start doing music and we’ve been doing it ever since\nHow did he help you to develop your sound?\nHe really just allowed me to experience different things in music, and listen to different people, he got a broad playlist in music everybody from west coast, to the east coast. And basically we just started developing there\nYou said in an interview before that your mum told you that whatever you do, you just gotta do it really, really well. What does she make of your success now?\nOh yeah, she loves it. She sees that I took heed in what she was saying because you have people that’s calling me the best at what I do, and you know l pride myself in that. She always said that whatever you do make sure that youre the best at it\nWhat kind of a son were you when you were younger?\nI was a good son, respectful, I never disrespected my mother, I never disrespected my father intentionally. Probably some of the things I did, outside of the house were a little bit outlandish, but as far as verbal disrespect or inner presence disrespect, never, so, I was a good son\nWhat are your earliest memories of their music?\nA lot of oldies, gangster rap was played in my household, which really inspired my sound today from new melodic driven, aggressive type feel\nWhat track or album have you listened to more than any other?\nThat’s hard, that’s tough. They played a lot of 2Pac All Eyez On Me, Me Against The World, they probably played that track a hundred thousand times in our house\nHow did the collaboration with Drake happen?\nI went on his Club Paradise tour and we really built a bond, a relationship, since the first time we met. He put me on his album, which was the interlude, red light interlude, we always said it was gonna work, it was just about finding the right song, that was the right song\nWhat happened in your first meeting with Dre?\nI was very excited, I wasn’t nervous at all. I was more excited, cause I knew that this was my shot, everything that lve worked for, everything I’ve built up to came down to that moment\nWhat happened in that moment?\nThat moment I recorded my first song with Dre, which was Compton, which is the last song on my album\nDo you speak to him on a daily basis?\nYeah I talk to him\nAnd what’s he up to at the moment?\nAt the moment he’s just working his Beats by Dre. Doing a lot of promo and press for that, getting buried in life right now\nCan you see yourself moving to projects outside of music like he does with Beats?\nYeah definitely. You know when you conquer one thing, you want to move on to the next and be able to challenge yourself? He inspired me to want to do that, once l get the years behind me, of being exceptionally great at music\nAre you creative in other ways outside of the music?\nYeah. Im very hands on with the whole visual and concepts beyond the music\nAre you a competitive person?\nVery competitive\nSo where does success lie?\nSuccess lies in challenging myself, thats where l get my success\nAnd how will you ever be fulfilled?\nProbably when l see that my music has touched more people than l can possibly imagine, and that point in time will come\nWhat do your lyrics say about you as a person?\nMy lyrics say that I have morals, say that I have confidence, say I have weaknesses, say I have strong points, say l am a human being\nWhat are the morals that you live by?\nTreat others the way you want to be treated. That’s the number one, that’s something that my mother always told me. That’s the one piece of advice I would give everybody and the world would be a better place\nCan you tell me about the picture on the front cover of the album?\nThe front cover really represents the lifestyle that I’m used to, the coming up, seeing a lot of parties, a lot of good times, a lot of bad times and really I blanked the eyes out so that you see the innocence, the little boy that’s in there, which is me. No matter what he is around, you still see the vulnerability in this kid, you know that he wants to figure out whats going on around him\nDo you think your music comes from a positive place?\nYes. My music comes from a positive place, only because I was once in a dark place before in my life so, to actually get to that positive space you have to come in this negative world, where you’re striving to do something better for yourself\nHow did you allow those negative situations to not affect you, or jade you?\nJust knowing something was bigger than me, something was bigger than just Compton, something was bigger than the trouble we were getting ourselves involved in, I knew something was more, and l wanted more for myself. Not only for myself but for the people l care about\nAre you still based in Compton now?\nNo, I’m a rolling stone. I don’t have a place to stay. Im roaming the world\nWhat do you do with all your stuff?\nMy mother has all that stuff. I’m in the world now, I like to see other things.

He declined to empty his pockets for a Things I Carry , but opened up about Barack Obama, being labeled a “conscious rapper” and Top Dawg Entertainment, the tight-knit label where he and the Black Hippy crew came up.\nFADER: So tell us about the album.\nKendrick Lamar: It’s really just a self portrait. I feel like everything that people have asked me in interviews should be explained in this one album. How I’m able to think the way I think now—it had to come from a negative place first. Family issues, morals. All that is in one debut. I feel like it’s a whole new market of people that’s listening to me now, so it’s almost like a reintroduction to who I am and furthering that longevity.\nF: Has being on a major label made things easier for you?\nKL: It’s really just the same procedure. I’m still with this Top Dawg Entertainment company and we already ran this company like a major. Top Dawg: four individual kids off the streets, man, and really just gave them a domain to do something positive. We always did the work. We understood that if we wanted to be amongst the elite, we gotta conduct ourselves. So us joining forces with Interscope is basically a continuance of that, giving us an opportunity to do something constructive with ourselves, and the most positive high ever.\nF: How’s it going with everybody? Ab-Soul’s album seems like it did well.\nKL: I think every artist on the label is in a great space. We never wanted to present it as only one main artist in the camp. We wanted to solidify everybody as their own individual. That’s what’s happening now. You see Schoolboy Q’s taking off. Rock already been there and still working. Ab-Soul. Everybody’s making their own lane and their own path to where people can’t look at it as if Top Dawg Entertainment is Kendrick Lamar. It’s all of us as a collective that’s representing this company.Stream: Kendrick Lamar, “Backseat Freestyle” F: The album looks like a picture of you as a baby at a house party. What’s the story behind that picture?\nKL: I think the people that’ll really understand the cover and the significance of every little piece in the portraits is people that’s been rocking with me since day one. Those are real portraits. They’ll understand what that means way before they hear the album. I’m sure that paints a big, big picture of what I represent, coming from this place, but it’s what I’ve been talking about, the lifestyle and putting a positive light on it at the end of the day.\nF: That runs through so much of your music, this uplifting spin on things.\nKL: There’s so much negativity in the world today. People know what’s real and know what’s fake. They know who really lived it and who’s trying to live it. That’s what I think people rock with me genuinely, because they know I’m not out here trying to glorify certain situations through these records or say I’m the biggest killer in the world. I don’t believe in none of these rappers anyway. The real gangsters, you never really see their faces because they’re either in the ground, in prison or behind the scenes.\nF: What is people’s biggest misconception about you?\nKL: Early on, when I started really getting attention, I seen a lot of blogs and a lot of media try to classify my music as one particular thing. That was like the “conscious” thing. It’s crazy, because they define it after just one project, certain things I was talking about. I never wanted that. I never want people to classify my music. That went out the window once I dropped a record called “Ignorance Is Bliss.” It was street, it was West Coast, it was a little bit more wisdom, and a person can’t really fake that. They figured out it wasn’t just the introspective side. At the end of the day, I want people to recognize me as just a human being, period. I talk about whatever I feel and whatever I go through.\nF: What makes you happiest right now?\nKL: It’s a few things. One, this influence I have on my community, on my city. I’m doing something in a positive light for these kids out here. A few of my homeboys, they’re locked up, they got kids and they’re going straight to jail as soon as they have these babies. Their sons, they’re five, six years old now. They’re looking at me to do something different. Their fathers respect that. So when their kid can see me on TV and get excited about it and know that I came from the same place they came from, that’s a great feeling to accomplish. That’s definitely a great feeling because I know it’s gonna start from that small place, that community in Compton, and eventually speed around the world. I wanna spark that idea in my own backyard first.\nF: In another interview recently that you said you don’t vote. Has anyone given you a hard time for saying that?\nKL: No. It was my own personal opinion and they know I’m true to myself. I’m not knocking the kids not to go out there and do it. Do it and get that experience. I gained that experience, it’s just a personal thing within myself and where I’m at in my life and how I feel about the world and spiritually. It has nothing to do with Obama. I want Obama to get that spot because I know he has a good heart. It’s just the people behind him. You have some people that say I’m in a space now where I disregard the people that are still struggling. That’s bullcrap, because at the end of the day, I’ve been thinking the same way since I was 16 years old. My whole thing is: people always look at the high places to come back down and help these communities, but at the end of the day, it starts with the people that’s in the communities. That’s what I really wanna stress.", "Lyrics From Snippet\n...gang \nLike  a chain more, this is purple rain\nYoung whippersnapper, hit you with my fucking aim...\n...you youth listening side off, so

After declaring himself King of New York, the Prince of Compton retreated to a land of gonzo Robin Thicke videos, Miley-fied MTV VMA performances, and unlimited BET awards nominations, while his peers lobbed response after response after response after response after, um, Hitler parody video.\nBut at long, last Lamar himself has issued a response, which more or less amounts to: Yall trippin. In an interview with Peter Rosenberg of New Yorks Hot 97, the Black Hippy was asked what he thought about all of the excitement surrounding his Big Sean cameo.  was just a feature verse, he humble-bragged before revealing that it took him a few days to notice the hubub, since hed been hanging out in the U.K. and all. Hed just wanted to rap some bars.\nThe 20-minute chat can be heard below — hit play on the YouTube rip below to hear Lamars thoughts on bicoastal rivalries, dangerous Twitter friends, and the business of elevating rap — but another gem emerged via a mere snippet of his forthcoming talk with Los Angeles radios Power 106. Regarding his self-coronation, the West Coast MC let out a kingly scoff, lamented that hes been misunderstood, and let slip that hes been conferring with other rap royals.\nI think thats a case of, yeah, maybe I have to dumb down my lyrics just a little bit, said Lamar. The irony of that line is the people that actually understood it and got it was the actual kings of New York — we’ve been sitting down with them this past week — and them understanding that it’s not about actually being the king of whatever coast, it’s about leaving a mark as great as Biggie, as great as Pac.” The entire Power 106 conversation airs Friday morning.", "Death", "Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances\nFinesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now Im countin this\nParmesan where my accountant lives, in fact Im downin this\nDUSSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts\nGirl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub\nOoh, that pussy good, wont you sit it on my taste bloods?\nI get way too petty once you let me do the extras\nPull up on your block, then break it down: we playin Tetris\nAM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk\nPiss out your per diem, you just gotta hate em, funk\nIf I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk\nIf I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk\nMy left stroke just went viral\nRight stroke put lil baby in a spiral\nSoprano C, we like to keep it on a high note\nIts levels to it, you and I know\nBitch, be humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nBitch, sit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nBitch, sit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nWho that nigga thinkin that he frontin on Man-Man? \nGet the fuck off my stage, Im the Sandman \nGet the fuck off my dick, that aint right\nI make a play fucking up your whole life\nIm so fuckin sick and tired of the Photoshop\nShow me somethin natural like afro on Richard Pryor\nShow me somethin natural like ass with some stretch marks\nStill will take you down right on your mamas couch in Polo socks\nAyy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy\nI blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy\nI dont fabricate it, ayy, most of yall be fakin, ayy\nI stay modest bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy\nThis that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy\nWatch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy\nIf I kill a nigga, it wont be the alcohol, ayy\nIm the realest nigga after all\nBitch, be humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nBitch, sit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nSit down \nBe humble \nBitch, sit down \nBe humble \nSit down", "Tröim vom Tell ire Winternacht\nAr aare ohni chleider wies mit ussesiiter immer machsch\nVo witem körsch paar ching si si am Wiehnachtslieder singe aber\nSii letscht öpfuschnitz gleitet langsam über d finger ab\nDr blich schiebt dr schiller böudet killer ab\nIsch d revoltä zügt isch zitig wiene pille danach bisch lings erwacht\nDu steisch uf gheisch ächt scho über dklinge ab\nU muet und zwang zwinge springe ab fuck wie söu das glinge mann\nWenn dr tell scho ufem gäud isch Willhelm scho wie ville tönt\nWirds villech grau u villech schön u villech morn u villech nümm\nMir spile nümm u dchile vou vo duble wo no a gott gloube\nU dini euterä armi lüüt wo no a cops gloube\nObwou ihri ching i de strass müese a stock gloube\nHoffnigi stoff choufe wär git isch kriminell\nU dr gessler isch nid geschter dr tell wird usglachet\nUnd dherrschaft wird erherter dfessle wärde feschter\nUnd e feschti luti musig und me nickt\nDr willhelm sitzt am bode verzöut mir sini gschicht seit\nFrüecher hani gschaffet und när het me üs i chrieg gschickt\nUnd womer nid hei wöue het me zwiflet adr liebi\nFür vater und familie es paar punkt füere zu linie\nUnd ei schluck whisky vode jungs ersetze d lilie\nDeheime uf dr strass kämpft bulle hei üs gchnüpplet\nUnd hei ke Job meh gfunge aus wäre mir sichtbari chrüpple\nGisch aues um wach zsi und aues nennt die tröimer\nIre wäut wo aues abutzt chasech niemer ufbäume\nUnd i ha viu zbereue aber sicher nid dä verse\nI weiss gwöhnt si isch wie rheuma und es stört\nDoch Eldorado isch nid goudschloss um goudschloss\nSondern glücklech und schoud los\nLuschtvou viu ächts ds isch doch scho viu wärt\nDs isch doch scho aues wärt\nGloub mer weni aues gäb\nDas em Gessler e pfiu düre haus gäng", "Girl give it to me\nGirl you know what it do, girl give it to me\nI got somethin’ brand new, girl give it to me\nI’ll put it all on you, girl give it to me\nWoooh, I got a gift for yah\nI got this for yah, a little Thicke for yah\nA big kiss for yah, I got a hit for yah\nBig dick for yah, let me give it to yah\nBaby, baby I gotta call for yah\nI got a whip for you, black car for yah\nBall hard for you, I know you wanna get fancy\nI know you wanna start dancin’\nHey girl\nYou know you’re lookin’ so damn fine\nYou’re lookin’ like you fell from the sky\nYou know you make a grown man cry\nI wanna give it to you, through the night\nAnd make everything you fantasize\nCome true, ooh baby\nI’ll make you so, so, so amazing\nI’ll give it to you\nGirl give it to me\nGirl give it to me\nGirl give it to me\nGirl give it to me\nOoh what’s that girl?\nWhat’s that baby?

Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So its only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where Im at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.\nI sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives.
